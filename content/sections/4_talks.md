### Improving the Performance of the Vector Engine Index in SAP HANA
<h4 style="text-align: center;">SAP</h4>

**Abstract**: SAP HANA Cloud features a Vector Engine for use in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the quality of response of AI-powered business applications using external knowledge. We share results of the micro-architectural analysis of the index construction time.  Based on this analysis we share how tuning the code significantly improved the performance of index construction.  Key to these improvements were NUMA optimizations and harnessing the memory prefetcher of modern Intel CPUs.
