**Abstract**: Compiling SQL queries into native machine code is appealing due to the elimination of interpretation overhead and the potential for highly efficient execution. However, there are concerns regarding code complexity, compilation time, and portability across hardware platforms. In this talk, we will demonstrate that it is possible to build a low-latency query compiler by factoring out the complex components, implementing them only once. The platform-specific components are then relatively straightforward, facilitating the targeting of new hardware platforms. Compared to traditional compiler backends, this approach achieves nearly the same execution speed while significantly reducing compilation times, thereby greatly improving overall query latency.

## Fresh Thinking Talk

### The Power of an Instruction

**Abstract**: Over the past few decades, the evolution of instructions, serving as the primary interface exposed by new hardware architectures, has significantly influenced how we write and optimize software. These instructions have even become so deeply embedded in libraries and abstractions that they are often invisible to the typical programmer.

Yet, selecting and leveraging the right instructions can have a substantial impact on both performance and correctness of the systems built on top of them. In this talk, I will explore the influence of modern instruction set extensions such as AVX for vectorized computation, CLFLUSH for cache management, and PREFETCH for reducing memory latency, and how they shape algorithm design, data layout and system behaviour.

Furthermore, I will outline potential advancements including mechanisms like eliminating redundant cache flushes and introducing multi-word compare-and-swap operations. We will explore how such extensions could simplify synchronization and reduce overhead, particularly in disaggregated and high-concurrency environments. These proposals aim to push the boundaries of what low-level primitives can offer, demonstrating how the smallest units of computation can impact on how we design and reason about modern systems.

### Improving the Performance of the Vector Engine Index in SAP HANA
<h4 style="text-align: center;">SAP</h4>

**Abstract**: SAP HANA Cloud features a Vector Engine for use in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the quality of response of AI-powered business applications using external knowledge. We share results of the micro-architectural analysis of the index construction time.  Based on this analysis we share how tuning the code significantly improved the performance of index construction.  Key to these improvements were NUMA optimizations and harnessing the memory prefetcher of modern Intel CPUs.
